# Fake-face-prediction
Artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, machine learning and neural networks are the
ones which represent extremely exciting and powerful machine learning-based
techniques used to solve many day-to-day life problems. Deep learning is used for
recognition, visual perception, decision-making and planning. Deep learning is a part of
machine learning which is a part again in artificial intelligence that has networks
capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabelled. Deep
learning which is a technique used to generate face detection and recognize it for real or
fake. Here in this paper, we used deep learning techniques to generate models for Real
and Fake face detection. Here our goal is determining a suitable way for detection of
real and fake faces. This model was designed and implemented, including both Dataset
of images: Real and Fake faces detection through the use of Deep learning algorithms
based on neural networks. We have trained dataset which consists of 6,000 images for
total in 30 epochs, for our model VGG - 16 giving 100% training accuracy, 99.18%
validation accuracy, training loss 0.0003, validation loss 0.0265, and testing accuracy 99%.
